1. Loading Data:

     Load the data from the CSV file using 'pd.read_csv'('home_prices.csv').
     Print the first few rows of the dataset to verify the content.

2.Preprocessing:

     Separate the features ('income', 'schools', 'hospitals', 'crime_rate') and the target variable ('price').
     Split the data into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.

3.Feature Scaling:

     Standardize the features to ensure all have the same scale, which helps the model perform better.

4.Training:
 
     Convert the data into the DMatrix format required by XGBoost.
     Define the model parameters and train the model on the training set.

5.Evaluation:

     Predict the prices on the test set and compute the RMSE to evaluate the model's performance.
